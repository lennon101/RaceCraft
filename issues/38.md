**Feature: Plan Your Perfect Season Page**

The feature introduces a dedicated page to help users plan their optimal racing season by managing training loads and recovery schedules based on their race dates. The page will include the following functionalities:

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Input Section:**
   - Allow users to input all races, including their names and dates.
   - Enable users to specify the peak weekly training load (in kilometers or hours) they want to achieve before each race.

2. **Calculation Section:**
   - Automatically calculate training plans based on user inputs.
   - Include a gradual increase in weekly training load, considering user-defined training blocks (e.g., recovery every 3 or 4 weeks).
   - Integrate recovery weeks into the schedule.

3. **Output Section:**
   - Present the planned training schedule visually (e.g., with graphs or tables).
   - Highlight peak load weeks and recovery weeks.

4. **Adjustable Settings:**
   - Allow users to tweak settings such as:
     - Length of training blocks.
     - Specific dates for recovery weeks.
     - Unit preferences (kilometers or hours).

### Development Steps:
1. **UI Design:**
   - Design wireframes/mockups for the "Plan Your Perfect Season" page.
   - Ensure an intuitive layout for inputs, calculations, and outputs.

2. **Backend Implementation:**
   - Create models to handle user input data (races, peak training loads, etc.).
   - Build algorithms to calculate training plans, ensuring flexibility for user-defined parameters (adjustable blocks, unit preferences, etc.).

3. **Frontend Implementation:**
   - Develop input forms and validation for race details and peak load data.
   - Render the calculated schedule dynamically using visual elements like graphs or tables.

4. **Integration & Testing:**
   - Ensure the UI/UX works seamlessly with backend logic.
   - Test various scenarios and edge cases (e.g., overlapping peak loads, invalid inputs).

5. **Documentation:**
   - Provide help tooltips or an FAQ to guide users on how to use the page.
